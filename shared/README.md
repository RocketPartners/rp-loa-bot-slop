# Shared Utilities

This directory contains utilities and helper functions that can be used across multiple LoA player bots.

## Structure

```
shared/
├── README.md       # This file
└── utils/          # Shared utility modules
    └── (future shared code)
```

## Guidelines

- Place only truly reusable code here
- Document all functions with docstrings
- Keep dependencies minimal
- Test thoroughly before moving to shared

## Future Additions

- Common Slack formatting utilities
- Azure authentication helpers
- Database connection managers
- Date/time utilities
- Error handling decorators
